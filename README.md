# minesweeper
Recreation of the classic game minesweeper. Includes graphics, timer, and infinite replayability.
The setup for the functions in the program are inspired by the ones that were given in the Geesespotter Project in my ECE 150 course at the University of Waterloo. 
However all the logic was written by me.
